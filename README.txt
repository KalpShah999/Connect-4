This program was initally created using NetBeans 8.2. The project can be loaded into that software and ran from there. A .jar file for the program can also be ran
  from the /dist folder. 
  
This program was also designed to incorporate player statistics using external files. Though there shouldn't be, if there is an issue in the reading/writing file
  process, the file directory can be changed from within the code with any given editing software.
  (P.S. The code was written in java so correct file reference syntax is required.)
